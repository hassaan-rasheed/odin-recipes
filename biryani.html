    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <p2>
     <ul>
        2½ cups basmati rice<br>
        ¼ cup cooking oil<br>
        8 whole cloves<br>
        4 black cardamom pods<br>
        4 cinnamon sticks<br>
        4 large onions, sliced thin<br>
        1 tablespoon garlic paste<br>
        1 tablespoon ginger paste<br>
        ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves<br>
        3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves<br>
        1 pound lamb chops<br>
        salt to taste<br>
        3 tomatoes, chopped<br>
        4 green chile peppers, halved lengthwise<br>
        2 teaspoons ground red pepper<br>
        2 tablespoons plain yogurt<br>
        2 tablespoons lemon juice<br>
        7½ cups water<br>
        1 teaspoon salt<br>

        <h4>Step 1</h4> 
        Place the basmati rice in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 30 minutes. Drain.
        
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry the cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the onions; cook and stir until the onions are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir the garlic paste and ginger paste into the onion mixture; cook until the garlic and ginger is fragrant, about 1 minute more. Sprinkle the cilantro and mint over the mixture and cook 1 minute more.
       
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        Add the lamb chops to the skillet; season with salt. Cook and stir the lamb until the meat begins to brown, about 20 minutes.
        
        <h4>Step 4</h4> 
        Stir the tomatoes, green chile peppers, and ground red pepper into the mixture; continue cooking until the oil begins to separate from the gravy, about 10 minutes. Add the yogurt and lemon juice; cover and cook until the lamb is tender, about 15 minutes. Add water as needed to keep the mixture from getting too dry. 

        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        Bring the rice, 7 1/2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan until the rice is nearly done yet a little chewy, 10 to 15 minutes; drain any excess water.

        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet; fry the sliced onion in the hot oil until lightly browned.      
    
        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        Layer about half the rice in the bottom of a deep pot with a lid. Spoon the lamb masala over the rice. Spread the fried onion over the lamb masala. Top with the remaining rice. Stir the saffron and warm milk together in a small bowl; pour over the top layer of rice. Cover the pot with the lid and place the pot over low heat; cook until the rice is thoroughly cooked, about 15 minutes.
